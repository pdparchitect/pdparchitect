My professional experience encompasses leadership and technical roles in industries related to Identity Verification, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Financial Technologies (FinTech), Gambling, Security Software Development, Security Automation, and Security Consulting.

Notable Information Security contributions include developing exploitation techniques against web technologies, common browsers, the portable document format (PDF), DHCP, UPnP, other network protocols, and NoSQL databases. I have also contributed some of the earliest research on embedded devices and IoT security.

I have spent a lot of time in information security research, and I have spoken at many international conferences and published two books.

In 2007 I founded GNUCITIZEN, a non-profit Information Security Think Tank, which was voted one of the most influential security sources in 2008. Our work was widely publicized in mainstream media. Under GNUCITIZEN, I've worked on many worthwhile projects with a long-term impact on the Information Security space, including founding a cutting-edge SaaS Information Security Company serving hundreds of thousands of customers across the globe.

Over my career, I have been deeply involved in many niche technology projects, which have become mainstream over time. This includes the development of 3rd engines back in the days of Doom and Quake, bringing security products and innovation to first versions of the iPhone and other common mobile platforms, early involvement in 3rd-printing and cryptocurrencies, and development of early prototypes of 3d worlds and games for VR and AR and others.

I like to read books on science, philosophy, and business strategy in my spare time. I am also an avid biohacker interested in cellular mechanics,  biochemistry, and genetic engineering.

## Projects

I founded several companies and built some somewhat useful things.

### [SecApps](https://secapps.com)

SecApps is a cloud environment for security tools and services. SecApps was originally conceived as a web security toolkit that ran directly on top of web standard browsers, leveraging a browser web extension. Today, SecApps is a mature security testing platform that customers can use for security monitoring, testing, bug bounty hunting, and more.

SecApps is my project of many projects, i.e. a meta-project. I use the SecApps platform to launch many types of interesting experiments.

SecApps is under Websecurify's management.

### [Cohesion](https://cohesion.sh)

Cohesion is a web application testing technology for continuous integration pipelines. Cohesion comes with many tools packed together to support everyday security testing tasks such as web security scanning, API fuzz testing, content discovery, and more.

Cohesion is under Websecurify's management.

### [Websecurify](https://websecurify.com)

Websecurify is an application security company based in London. Websecurify was initially founded to support the Websecurify automated security scanner, which was originally open source. Due to a lack of contributions, the desktop scanner was canceled and morphed into SecApps.

### [GNUCITIZEN](https://gnucitizen.org)

I founded GNUCITIZEN to advance public understanding of offensive and defensive information security technologies, to educate and share information with its members and the public on best practices, tools, and techniques for such coverage, and to represent the interests of its members.

This has been my personal space for a long time.

### [PownJS](https://pownjs.com)

Pown.js is an experimental security framework for node. It aims to be security-driven with contributions via the NPM package registry. The project is currently in its infancy but it play a very important part for secapps.com.

### [OpenDevSecOps](https://opendevsecops.org)

The OpenDevSecOps project mission is to provide a world-class resource for implementing complete devsecops and secops programs within organizations of any shape and size using off-the-shelf tools and access to our vibrant community.

### Webreaver (defunct)

The first in the world web application security scanner for iOS and macOS. Getting this published required having special permissions from Apple.

### Proxy App (defunct)

The first native web interception proxy for MacOS. It topped the Mac App Store charts when it launched but I am not longer interested to support it so it is dead.

### House Of Hackers (defunct)

The first and the only hacker social network. The network was formed in May 2008 and quickly reached over 30,000 members. Due to many reasons, I had to shut it down. Closing House of Hackers is by far one of the most regretful decisions I have ever made.

### Blogsecurify (defunct)

Back in the days, blogging platforms were a no match to seasoned hackers, and the GNUCITIZEN team was good at hacking. So I decided to fix it by creating a set of WordPress plugins and tools to protect WordPress blogs worldwide. Blogsecurify, as far as we know, was the first security tooling explicitly made to protect WordPress installations.

### Securls (defunct)

I bought securls.com to create an alternative to popurls.com. While the project was interesting, it never gained any traction. The domain expired, and someone else bought it under my nose. Feel free to transfer it back.

### Agile Hacking (defunct)

The idea behind Agile Hacking was to create the first crowdsourced information security resource - essentially an alternative to all information security books combined. The project existed briefly and never materialized to anything other than a few small contributions. I have created a GitHub [organization](https://github.com/agilehacking) in memory of this project. Feel free to contact me if you want to take the lead.

### Exploit Sweatshop (defunct)

Exploit Sweatshop was a failed attempt to create a public vulnerability acquisition program. There is more about this over [here](https://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/exploit-sweatshop/).
