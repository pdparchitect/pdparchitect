My professional experience encompasses leadership and technical roles in industries related to Identity Verification, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Financial Technologies (FinTech), Gambling, Security Software Development, Security Automation, and Security Consulting.

Notable Information Security contributions include developing exploitation techniques against web technologies, common browsers, the portable document format (PDF), DHCP, UPnP, other network protocols, and NoSQL databases. I have also contributed some of the earliest research on embedded devices and IoT security.

I have spent a lot of time in information security research, and I have spoken at many international conferences and published two books.

In 2007 I founded GNUCITIZEN, a non-profit Information Security Think Tank, which was voted one of the most influential security sources in 2008. Our work was widely publicized in mainstream media. Under GNUCITIZEN, I've worked on many worthwhile projects with a long-term impact on the Information Security space, including founding a cutting-edge SaaS Information Security company serving hundreds of thousands of customers across the globe.

Over my career, I have been deeply involved in many niche technology projects, which have become mainstream over time. This includes the development of 3rd engines back in the days of Doom and Quake, bringing security products and innovation to first versions of the iPhone and other common mobile platforms, early involvement in 3rd-printing and cryptocurrencies, and development of early prototypes of 3d worlds and games for VR and AR and others.

I like to read books on science, philosophy, and business strategy in my spare time. I am also an avid biohacker interested in cellular mechanics,  biochemistry, and genetic engineering.

## Projects

I founded several companies and built some somewhat useful things.

### [SecApps](https://secapps.com)

SecApps is a cloud environment for security tools and services. SecApps was originally conceived as a web security toolkit that ran directly on top of web standard browsers, leveraging a browser web extension. Today, SecApps is a mature security testing platform that customers can use for security monitoring, testing, bug bounty hunting, and more.

SecApps is my project of many projects, i.e. a meta-project. I use the SecApps platform to launch many types of interesting experiments.

SecApps is under Websecurify's management.

### [Cohesion](https://cohesion.sh)

Cohesion is a web application testing technology for continuous integration pipelines. Cohesion comes with many tools packed together to support everyday security testing tasks such as web security scanning, API fuzz testing, content discovery, and more.

Cohesion is under Websecurify's management.

### [Websecurify](https://websecurify.com)

Websecurify is an application security company based in London. Websecurify was initially founded to support the Websecurify automated security scanner, which was originally open source. Due to a lack of contributions, the desktop scanner was canceled and morphed into SecApps.

### [GNUCITIZEN](https://gnucitizen.org)

I founded GNUCITIZEN to advance public understanding of offensive and defensive information security technologies, to educate and share information with its members and the public on best practices, tools, and techniques for such coverage, and to represent the interests of its members.

This has been my personal space for a long time.

### [PownJS](https://pownjs.com)

Pown.js is an experimental security framework for node. It aims to be security-driven with contributions via the NPM package registry. The project is currently in its infancy but it play a very important part for secapps.com.

### [OpenDevSecOps](https://opendevsecops.org)

The OpenDevSecOps project mission is to provide a world-class resource for implementing complete devsecops and secops programs within organizations of any shape and size using off-the-shelf tools and access to our vibrant community.
